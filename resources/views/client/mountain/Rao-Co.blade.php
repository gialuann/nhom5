<h3 class="mountaintitle">Confusion about names </h3>
<p>From 2011 to early 2012, some online travel guide articles mistakenly called Phu Luong mountain Ta Chi Nhu . This confusion caused Ta Chi Nhu to be widely popularized and become the unofficial name of Phu Luong mountain. A tour group placed a mountain peak stele with the name Ta Chi Nhu on Phu Luong peak in 2016</p>
