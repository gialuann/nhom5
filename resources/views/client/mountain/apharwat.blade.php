<p>
    During winters, it's mandatory to hire a chain taxi from Tangmarg a town located near Gulmarg. During summers you can hire a private cab to the base of Gondola starting point. From the base, you can take a gondola ride to the summit above. To reach Apharwat which is phase 2, you need to first take a cable car to phase 1 which is from Gulmarg to Kongdoori.
