<h2>Conquer Chúa Mountain</h2>
<p>Nui Chua National Park is a national park in Ninh Hai district, Ninh Thuan province, Vietnam established in 2003 under Decision No. 134/2003/QD-TTg of the Prime Minister of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Nam on July 9, 2003. On April 14, 2021, this national park was recognized by UNESCO as a World Biosphere Reserve with an area of ​​106,600 hectares along with Kon Ha Nung Biosphere Reserve. With forests, semi-deserts, and seas characterized by unique and rare dry regions typical of Vietnam and Southeast Asia.</p>
<h3 class="mountaintitle">Geographical location</h3>
<p>Nui Chua National Park is located in Ninh Hai district, Ninh Thuan province, bordering Khanh Hoa province. In the easternmost position of the South Central region, where the Southeast and South Central regions meet, the coordinates are from 11°35'25" to 11°48'38" north latitude and 109°4'5" to 109°14'15" east longitude, the northern limit is the border with Khanh Hoa province. If based on the natural terrain of the entire mountain complex, the northern boundary must be 11°52'27" at Mui Xop of Hon Mot right at the mouth of Cam Ranh Bay, so the north-south direction will be about 33 km and the total direction The coastline will be 57 km long. <br>
<br>
The Nui Chua area has three sides facing the sea. Immediately to the north is the lower part of Cam Ranh Bay in Cam Lap commune, Cam Ranh city, Khanh Hoa province. To the east and south is the East Sea with Vinh Hai and Nhon Hai communes of Ninh Hai district. The south is Nai lagoon, the west is limited by National Highway 1.</p>

<h3 class="mountaintitle">Topography and geomorphology</h3>
<p>On a small scale, in terms of geomorphology, the Nui Chua National Park area belongs to the Nui Chua dome block mountain range, extending in the north-northeast-southeast direction, limited to the south by the Krongpha - Phan Rang fault. , west by the Cam Ranh - Phan Rang fault. This mountain massif is the result of repeated tectonic orogenic activities during the Miocene and Pliocene periods. Dome-raising and leveling activities in different periods have created terrain levels that are similar to today's terrain levels. With middle Miocene leveling surfaces at an altitude of about 850-1040m, late Miocene 700 - 850m, early Pliocene 500 - 650m, middle Pliocene 300 - 350m and late Pliocene 150 - 200m. These surfaces develop around the middle Miocene surface almost in the center, are low and gradually younger in all directions.</p> <br>
<p>This massif, after the early late Miocene uplift phase, still existed as a hilly plain about 170 - 200m high. Until the middle Pliocene, the massif reached an altitude of 600-650m, and subsequent uplift phases increased the height. another 300-400m. Accompanying the lifting activities, the mountain mass was also strongly eroded and exposed intrusive rock blocks such as the intrusive rock blocks of the Ca Na complex. Up to now, the processes of erosion, landslides and erosion are still developing strongly.</p><br>
<p>On a broader scale, for the entire adjacent Phan Rang area, Phan Rang belongs to the morphological architecture of the neo-tectonic ring margin accumulation delta. The delta is formed as a result of subsidence accompanied by erosion, which is At the intersection of the Cam Ranh-Phan Rang, Krongpha-Phan Rang fault systems, the terrain is greatly lowered and eroded. The northern limit is the Nui Chua massif. Overall, the Phan Rang area is limited by higher mountain blocks, forming a closed basin that only exposes the east side to the sea. From the neo-tectonic activities that have shaped today's terrain in the surrounding areas of the National Park and in the Nui Chua area, in terms of topography, the National Park has the following characteristics:</p><br>
<div class="ul-li-mountain">
    <ul class="pac-details ">
        <li><p>The Nui Chua area is a fairly seamless mountain massif, seen from satellite images, Nui Chua is shaped like a turtle with its head facing the South, the tail is the protruding part of Xop cape protruding into Cam Ranh bay as if coming from the sea. The sea crawls onto the land. This mountain massif has many peaks at different heights, the highest peak is Co Tuy mountain peak with a height of 1,039m.</p></li>

        <li><p>The terrain gradually lowers from the center, the northern and western parts have a steeper slope than the south and east. In the west and southwest, the terrain is divided by small mountain blocks forming ridge valleys in the northeast-southwest direction; In the north, east and southeast, the terrain is less divided, gradually lowering from the top of the mountain to the sea</p></li>

        <li><p>Terrain with elevation below 300m: distributed in the east and south and areas in the north bordering the sea, terrain less fragmented, slope below 200.</p></li>

        <li><p>The terrain has an altitude of 300-700m: distributed in the west and southwest, the terrain is strongly divided, forming valleys and steep slopes over 200, up to 350.</p></li>

        <li><p>Terrain with an altitude of over 700m: distributed in the central part, with many mountain peaks at different altitudes, separated by valleys, with slopes from 200 to 400.</p></li>
    </ul><br>
</div>
<p>Further to the southwest is the small plain of Phan Rang, surrounded by high mountains. The entire Nui Chua-Phan Rang area almost forms a basin terrain, separated in the north, west and south by mountain blocks with terrain heights of over 500m to over 1000m. The north and south ends are blocked by mountain blocks spreading to the sea with an average altitude of 500-700m.</p>
